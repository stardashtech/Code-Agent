class ConflictResolverCLI:
    \"\"\"
    Provides a basic command-line interface to present dependency conflicts 
    to the user and get their resolution choice.
    
    NOTE: This is a basic implementation based on a hypothetical conflict structure.
    It relies on the ConflictDetector (currently a placeholder) providing 
    structured conflict information and potential resolution options.

    def resolve_conflicts(self, conflicts: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        \"\"\"
        Presents conflicts to the user one by one and prompts for resolution.

        Args:
            conflicts: A list of conflict dictionaries (structure TBD).
                       Expected keys might include 'package', 'versions', 
                       'resolution_options'.

            A dictionary mapping package names to the chosen resolution strategy 
            (e.g., {'some-lib': 'Keep 1.x'}).
